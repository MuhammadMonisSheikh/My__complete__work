    <h1>Marine Biology</h1>
    <h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
    <p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials
        from Earth's crust,CSS treats each HTML element
        as if it appears in a box, and the
        background-color property
        sets the color of the background
        for that box.
        You can specify your choice of
        background color in the same
        three ways you can specify
        foreground colors: RGB values,
        hex codes, and color names
        (covered on the next page).
        If you do not specify a
        background color, then the
        background is transparent.
        By default, most browser
        windows have a white background, but browser users
        can set a background color for
        their windows, so if you want
        to be sure that the background
        is white you can use the
        background-color property on
        the element. We have also used the padding
        property to separate the text
        from the edges of the boxes.
        This makes it easier to read and
        you will learn more about this
        property on page 313.Because some browsers will
        not recognize RGBA colors, you
        can offer a fallback so that they
        display a solid color. If there are
        two rules that apply to the same
        element, the latter of the two
        will take priority. To create the
        fallback, you can specify a color
        as a hex code, color name or
        RGB value, followed by the rule
        that specifies an RGBA value. If
        the browser understands RGBA
        colors it will use that rule. If it
        doesn't, it will use the RGB value.
        At the time of writing, the
        opacity and rgba properties
        are only supported by the most
        recent browsers.

  <p class="one">CSS3 introduces the opacity
    property which allows you to
    specify the opacity of an element
    and any of its child elements.
    The value is a number between
    0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
    is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
    opacity).Because some browsers will
    not recognize RGBA colors, you

    <p class="two">The CSS3 rgba property allows
        you to specify a color, just like
        you would with an RGB value,
        but adds a fourth value to
        indicate opacity. This value is
        known as an alpha value and is
        a number between 0.0 and 1.0
        (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity
        and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The
        rgba value will only affect the
        element on which it is applied
        (not child elements).
